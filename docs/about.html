<div class="article">
<p>Some things I&#8217;m interested in at the&nbsp;moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building and participating in organizations that are unusually effective, or greater than the sum of their&nbsp;parts</li>
<li>Contributing to solving the current/impending global climate&nbsp;crisis</li>
<li>Computing systems that interact with the &#8220;world of atoms&#8221;, not just the &#8220;world of&nbsp;bits&#8221;</li>
<li>Making computing more accessible and intuitive for everybody, not just&nbsp;&#8220;experts&#8221;</li>
<li>Riding and working on motorcycles – currently a <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_Guzzi_V1000_G5">1981 Moto&nbsp;Guzzi</a></li>
<li>Playing chess (including <a href="https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?30565171">in-person</a> when I can find the&nbsp;time)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the fall of 2022, my partner and I both decided to take sabbaticals from work. We spent the subsequent year living on a 34&#8217; sailboat and travelling up and down the East Coast of the <span class="caps">US</span> between Maine and the&nbsp;Bahamas.</p>
<p>Most recently, I&#8217;ve worked on helping care managers improve health outcomes for the most vulnerable New Yorkers at <a href="https://relevant.healthcare/">Relevant Healthcare</a>/<a href="https://footholdtechnology.com/care-coordination-software/">Foothold Technology</a>. Before that, I&#8217;ve worked at a <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">mapping startup</a> on billing/usage metering/<span class="caps">IAM</span>, and on open-source <a href="https://circl.lu/projects/CIRCLean/">security tools</a> for&nbsp;journalists.</p>
<p>I did a batch at the Recurse Center from July-September of 2016&#8230;and I liked it so much I and did it a second time from January-March of 2020! The Recurse Center is a self-directed “writers retreat” for programmers of all levels, backgrounds, and interests. It&#8217;s one of the most interesting communities/learning experiments I&#8217;ve encountered, and my favorite educational experience of my life so far. And, it&#8217;s free to attend! You can learn more at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=70c642aa7102a1a2b43dc2ba3585c703">recurse.com</a>, or by reading my <a href="https://www.danielputtick.com/writing/return-statement.html">Return Statement</a> from my first&nbsp;batch.</p>
<p>Before I started programming, I studied <a href="http://www.nbb.emory.edu">Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology</a> and worked in neuroscience research labs at <a href="https://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/primary/weinshenker-david.html">Emory University</a> and <a href="https://www.chartofflab.com/">McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School</a>. My research interests involved the neural mechanisms of drug addiction and withdrawal. I contributed to several academic journal articles and presented our work at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span>.</p>
