<p>I&#8217;ve taken advantage of some free time to make some design and functionality changes to this site. The most notable of these is that I&#8217;ve split written content into two categories: &#8220;writing&#8221; and &#8220;journal&#8221;. I&#8217;d like to make it easier for myself to write more frequently and in smaller, less thoroughly-edited chunks. I think the barrier there is largely psychological, and I&#8217;m hoping this well help. The &#8220;journal&#8221; will be things I&#8217;ve written in one sitting, with perhaps a single pass of editing. I won&#8217;t try to guarantee that they&#8217;re accurate, well-written, well-thought-out, unique, etc. Many of them might end up being titled with just a date. The &#8220;writing&#8221; section will be longer pieces that I&#8217;ve invested some amount of effort into. I&#8217;ll intend to make them evergreen, and update them if I have changes to my thinking. It&#8217;s possible that some pieces will start out as journal entries before morphing into full-on writing: that&#8217;s another goal of this&nbsp;experiment.</p>
<p>Along with the main Atom feed, the two categories have their own Atom feeds, to make it easy to follow them separately. I&#8217;ve sorted my existing writing into the two categories based on how well I feel they&#8217;ve held&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>In terms of design tweaks, I threw out the Pelican theme I had chosen and lightly modified to my liking and wrote my own html/css from scratch. I found it was noticeably different to think about the &#8220;right&#8221; way to do things rather than just tweaking values until it looked the way I hoped. I also had to learn some details of a few css techniques I had only heard about previously, such as flexbox. The performance still isn&#8217;t as snappy as I&#8217;d want it. After some brief profiling it seems likely there are some gains to be had from optimizing and minifying the css I wrote. But, I think it will do for&nbsp;now.</p>
