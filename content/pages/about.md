Summary: About me

Some things I'm interested in at the moment:

- Building and participating in organizations that are unusually effective, or greater than the sum of their parts
- Contributing to solving the current/impending global climate crisis
- Computing systems that interact with the "world of atoms", not just the "world of bits"
- Making computing more accessible and intuitive for everybody, not just "experts"
- Riding and working on motorcycles – currently a [1981 Moto Guzzi](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_Guzzi_V1000_G5)
- Playing chess (including [in-person](https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?30565171) when I can find the time)

In the fall of 2022, my partner and I both decided to take sabbaticals from work. We spent the subsequent year living on a 34' sailboat and travelling up and down the East Coast of the US between Maine and the Bahamas.

Most recently, I've worked on helping care managers improve health outcomes for the most vulnerable New Yorkers at [Relevant Healthcare](https://relevant.healthcare/)/[Foothold Technology](https://footholdtechnology.com/care-coordination-software/). Before that, I've worked at a [mapping](https://www.mapbox.com/) startup on billing/usage metering/IAM, and on open-source [security tools](https://circl.lu/projects/CIRCLean/) for journalists.

I did a batch at the Recurse Center from July-September of 2016...and I liked it so much I and did it a second time from January-March of 2020! The Recurse Center is a self-directed “writers retreat” for programmers of all levels, backgrounds, and interests. It's one of the most interesting communities/learning experiments I've encountered, and my favorite educational experience of my life so far. And, it's free to attend! You can learn more at [recurse.com](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=70c642aa7102a1a2b43dc2ba3585c703), or by reading my [Return Statement]({filename}/journal/return-statement.md) from my first batch.

Before I started programming, I studied [Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology](http://www.nbb.emory.edu) and worked in neuroscience research labs at [Emory University](https://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/primary/weinshenker-david.html) and [McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School](https://www.chartofflab.com/). My research interests involved the neural mechanisms of drug addiction and withdrawal. I contributed to several academic journal articles and presented our work at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in Washington, DC.
