Summary: About me


I’m currently excited about a few categories of problems, namely:


- Techniques and processes that result in high code quality and maintainable software, including testing and documentation.


- Designing interfaces and APIs that work for everybody.


- Learning and teaching programming more effectively.


I did a batch at the Recurse Center in Summer 2016. The Recurse Center is a self-directed “writers retreat” for programmers of all levels, backgrounds, and interests. I spent three months in NYC teaching myself more about Python internals, network programming, interpreters/programming languages, concurrency, and testing. Oh, and it's free! You can learn more at [recurse.com](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=70c642aa7102a1a2b43dc2ba3585c703), or read my [Return Statement]({filename}/writing/return-statement.md).

Before programming, I studied [Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology](http://www.nbb.emory.edu) and worked in neuroscience research at [Emory University](http://genetics.emory.edu/research/weinshenker/) and [McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School](http://www.mcleanhospital.org/research-programs/elena-h-chartoff-neurobiology-motivated-behavior-laboratory). My research interests involved the neural mechanisms of drug addiction and withdrawal. I contributed to several academic journal articles and presented some of our work at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in Washington, DC. Along the way I learned how to program and realized that programming was a superpower worth spending the time to master.
