This is the personal website of Dan Puttick

I’m currently excited to be learning more about a few categories of problems, namely: 

* The issues involved with programming for the web at scale, particularly concurrent/asynchronous programming and distributed systems.
* Designing user interfaces that work for everybody.
* How to learn and teach programming better, especially with the intent of improving code quality and collaboration in the spirit of the software craftsmanship movement.

I did a batch at the Recurse Center in Summer 2016. The Recurse Center is a self-directed “writers retreat” for programmers of all levels, backgrounds, and interests. I spent three months in NYC teaching myself more about Python internals, network programming, interpreters/programming languages, concurrency, and testing. Oh, and it's free! If this sounds like something you’d be remotely interested in, learn more at `recurse.com <https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=70c642aa7102a1a2b43dc2ba3585c703>`_.

Before programming, I studied Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology and worked in neuroscience research at `Emory University <http://genetics.emory.edu/research/weinshenker/>`_ and `McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School <http://www.mcleanhospital.org/research-programs/elena-h-chartoff-neurobiology-motivated-behavior-laboratory>`_. My research interests involved the mechanisms of drug addiction and withdrawal. I contributed to several academic journal articles and presented our work at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in Washington, DC. Along the way I learned how to program and realized that programming was a superpower worth spending the time to master.
